# Knight-Traversal

A site that allows the user to allow the user to mess with the knight

1. initialPage.js: Creates mark down
2. app.js: main application file
3. board.js: File for the board class and other related utility functions
4. controller.js: A place for all of the eventlisteners
5. modules.js: Contains modules/objects, which we use as data-structures to control the site.
6. rendering.js: File that contains functions that render or change stuff on the screen, and other very closely
   related functions

NOTE: The drop down nav links don't lead anywhere, it's just there for that I
could practice drop down logic
